      Our company was founded by a group of students who recognized the need for a platform that caters to the specific needs of students. They observed that students often struggle to find affordable used products or a reliable platform to sell their own items. The company was established with the idea of providing a safe and efficient platform for students to buy, sell, and borrow products.
